### Games List:

2. Rock Paper Scissors


#### CHANGELOG

###### 2019/01/06
Coin flip just simulates a heads/tails decision, but can keep track of past flips for later stats analysis.

Rock Paprr Scissors is currently very alpha (rough). The comparrison algorithm is proper, condensing conditional stwtements doen to 3 as opposed to 9 checks. Just need to make it look pretty.
